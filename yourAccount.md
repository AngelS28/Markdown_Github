# Configuring your GitHub Account

The first step in starting with GitHub is to create an account, choose a product that fits your needs best, verify your email, and set up your profile. <br />

There are several types of accounts on GitHub. Every person who uses GitHub has an account, which can be part of multiple organizations and teams. Your account is your identity on GitHub and represents you as an individual. <br />

## 1. Creating a GitHub account <br />

To sign up for an account for GitHub, you can navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and follow the prompts to create your account. <br />

To keep your GitHub account secure you should use a **strong and unique password**. <br />
The password should be at least:  <br />

* 8 characters long, if it includes a number and a lowercase letter or,
* 15 characters long with any combination of characters. <br />
* Generate a unique password for GitHub. If you use your GitHub password elsewhere and that service is compromised, then attackers or other malicious actors could use that information to access your account on GitHub.
