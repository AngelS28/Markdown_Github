# Configuring your GitHub Account

The first step in starting with GitHub is to create an account, choose a product that fits your needs best, verify your email, and set up your profile. <br />

There are several types of accounts on GitHub. Every person who uses GitHub has an account, which can be part of multiple organizations and teams. Your account is your identity on GitHub and represents you as an individual. <br />

## 1. Creating a GitHub account <br />

To sign up for an account for GitHub, you can navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and follow the prompts to create your account. <br />

To keep your GitHub account secure you should use a **strong and unique password**. <br />
The password should be at least:  <br />

* 8 characters long, if it includes a number and a lowercase letter or,
* 15 characters long with any combination of characters. <br />
* Generate a unique password for GitHub. If you use your GitHub password elsewhere and that service is compromised, then attackers or other malicious actors could use that information to access your account on GitHub. 

## 2. Verifying your email address <br />
You can verify your email address after signing up for a new account or adding a new one. If an email address is undeliverable or bouncing, it will be unverified. <br />

### Here are the steps to verify your email: <br />

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.

2. On the left section of the sidebar, click **Emails** <br />

3. Under the email page, you can check the verification for your primary email, and allows you to add another email for backup. On the backup email section, it allows you to receive notifications in case there needs to be a password reset. <br />

4. GitHub will send you notifications through your primary email after you have verified your email. It's to note that, you should check and ensure that you're signed into the correct account on GitHub.
