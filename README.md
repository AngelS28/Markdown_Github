# Navigator Of GitHub<br />

Made by Angel Sun <br />

<br />
The purpose of this tutorial is to help new users navigate and learn some of the interesting features that have been embedded in GitHub. In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to create a personal account, import or create repositories, collaborate and work with others, and try to build a connection with the GitHub community. 
<br />

The tutorial is made for new users who have never used GitHub and users who have basic knowledge but are not very familiar with GitHub.
