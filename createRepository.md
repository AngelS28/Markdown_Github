# Create Your Repository

## Commit your first change 

When you had finished creating your new repository, you initialized it with a *README* file. *README* file is a great place to describe your project in more detail or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your *README* file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.
<br />

Let's commit a change to the README file. 
<br />

1. In your repository's list of files, select *README.md*
