# Create Your Repository 

You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open-source projects. With open-source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. You can use repositories to collaborate with others and track your work.

## Commit your first change 

When you had finished creating your new repository, you initialized it with a *README* file. *README* file is a great place to describe your project in more detail or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your *README* file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.
<br />

<br />
