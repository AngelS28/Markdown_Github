# Fork your repository
A fork is a new repository that shares cod and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository. 
<br />
## Propose changes to someone else's project
For example, you can forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you have found, you can:
<br />
* Fork the repository.
* Make the fix.
* Submit a pull request to the project owner.

## Fork a repository
You might fork a project to propose changes to the upstream repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. Here are the steps to fork the repository. 

<br />

1. Go to GitHub.com and navigate to [AngelS28/helloYou](https://github.com/AngelS28/helloYou) repository.

<br />

2.. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.

3. Under "Owner", select the drop won menu and click an owner for the forked repository.

<br />

4. By defualt, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
  <br />

5. Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
<br />

6. Optionally, select **Copy the DEFAULT branch only**. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open source projects, you only need to copy the default branch.
<br />

7. Finally, click on **Create fork**.
