# Getting familiar with Tools and Features <br />

To best use GitHub, you'll need to set up Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. To effectively collaborate on GitHub, you'll install and set up Git. <br />

## Using Git
To use Git on the command line, you'll need to download, install, and configure Git on your computer. If you do not need to work with files locally, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions directly in the browser, including: <br />

* Creating a repository
* Forking a repository
* Managing Files
* Being social <br />

## Setting up Git 

1. [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) <br />
<br />**NOTE**: Most Chrome OS devices from 2020 onwards now have a built-in Linux environment, which includes Git. To enable it, go to the Launcher, search Linuex, and click **Turn On**.
<br />
  If you are using an older Chrome OS device, another method is reuqired:
  <br/>
  
<br />   a. Install a terminal emulator such as Termux from the Google Play Store on your Chrome OS device. 
  <br />
  
  b. From the ternminal emulator that you installed, install Git. For example, in Termux, enter `apt install git` and then type `y` when prompted.  <br />
  

  3. Setting up your Git username for **every** repository on your computer <br />
  Open Git Bash. <br />
  <br />Set a Git username: <br />
  `git config -- global user.name "Angel Sun"`<br />
 <br /> Confirm that you have set the Git username correctly: <br />
  `$ git config -- global user.name` <br />
    `> Angel Sun`
<br />

## Authenticating with GitHub and Git

When you connect to a GitHub repository Git, you will need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH. You can authenticate to GitHub using GitHub CLI, for either HTTP or SSH. <br />

## Learn about `gh auth login`
Authenicate with a GitHub host. 
<br />

The default authentication model is a web-based browser flow. After completetion, an authentication toke nwill be stored securely in the system credential store. If a credntial store is not found or there is an issue using it gh will fallback to writing the token to a plain text file. You can use `gh auth status` for its stored location. 

<br />

## Next Steps

You now have Git and GitHub all set up. You may now choose to create a repository where you can put your projects. Saving your code in a repository allows you to back up your code and share it around the world. <br />

* Creating a repository for your project allows you to store code in GitHub. This provides a backup of your work that you can choose to share with other developers. "Create a repository".
<br />

* Forking a repository will allow you to make changes to another repository without affecting the orginal. "Fork a repository"
<br />

* Each repository on GitHub is owned by a person or an organization. You can interact with the people, repositories, and organizations by connecting and following them on GitHub. "Be Soical"
<br />

* GitHub has a great support community where you can aks for jep and talk to people from around the world. Join the conversion on "GitHub Community"
